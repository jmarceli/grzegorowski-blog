It is especially true if you are a WordPress developer which happens to be my case. Why would anyone bother to choose something else?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[deprecation warning] This article was written for Ghost 0.x which is now considered to be a LTS version. For new blogs consider using Ghost 1.x.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Playing with new technologies is one of my favorite leisure activities so I decided to check out Ghost a modern solution for simple blogging websites. Here are some of my findings and impressions.</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>In my opinion the only problem with Ghost installation is finding a suitable hosting provider. Nodejs support on a common shared hosting platforms in my country is still hard to get. Fortunately, my favorite one supports Nodejs out of the box and it is really easy to use. Just <a href=\"http://ghost.grzegorowski.com/setup-ghost-blog-on-mydevil-net/\">\"copy and paste\" Ghost files</a> according to the official documentation, comparing to the WordPress installation it doesn't seem to be much harder. After the installation process just access <code class=\"language-text\">http://yourdomain.com/ghost</code> URL and create an admin account. I was afraid that Nodejs app setup will be much more complicated.</p>\n<h2>Admin panel</h2>\n<p>The admin panel of a Ghost, in my opinion, is extremely simple thanks to the fact that this is only a blogging platform and it doesn't try to be anything more. I doubt if anyone could have any problems with it.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 752px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/19df3b577465a5bf1f57ac6e681ba9dd/1c0cc/screen-shot-2017-03-18-at-23.16.26.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.91489361702128%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Ghost admin panel view\"\n        title=\"Ghost admin panel view\"\n        src=\"/static/19df3b577465a5bf1f57ac6e681ba9dd/1c0cc/screen-shot-2017-03-18-at-23.16.26.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/19df3b577465a5bf1f57ac6e681ba9dd/a1986/screen-shot-2017-03-18-at-23.16.26.png 210w,\n/static/19df3b577465a5bf1f57ac6e681ba9dd/ad7fb/screen-shot-2017-03-18-at-23.16.26.png 420w,\n/static/19df3b577465a5bf1f57ac6e681ba9dd/1c0cc/screen-shot-2017-03-18-at-23.16.26.png 752w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Editor</h2>\n<p>The only thing that might be confusing for non-technical users is the Editor.

I mean writing in Markdown is easy, I'm a <em>Vim</em> enthusiast so I don't like leaving my keyboard home row to do some styling. Ghost speed gives me an illusion of using a native App (which is really nice), while limited options are \"just enough\" to get the job done if we are talking about running a blog.</p>","excerpt":"WordPress is an obvious choice if you want to write your own online blog.
