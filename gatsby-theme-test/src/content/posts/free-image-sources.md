Here is a list of popular pages which offers free images. By free images I mean [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) (or similar) licensed pictures which may be used (and modified) for commercial projects without any attribution related restrictions.
I decided to list only those services which have some kind of search available because without that feature it's nearly impossible to find something that you want.
