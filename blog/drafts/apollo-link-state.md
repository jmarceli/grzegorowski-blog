This will be a brief description of the Redux to Apollo migration process.

## What is apollo-link-state package?
It's like Redux store but handled with GraphQL queried instead of Actions and Reducers.
## What is the advantage of using apollo-link-state instead of Redux?
We have unified way of getting data from local cache and server which may save us a lot of time and code to get things done.
